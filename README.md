## What is this?
Taskbank is an web based todo app which is based on GTD principles. Just add tasks to your to Taskbank and it will automatically create daily task lists for you.

Taskbank lets you:
- Sort your tasks based on importance, deadlines, and dependence on other tasks.
- Filter your tasks depending on the context, place and tags.
- Create projects that consist of multiple tasks.
- Add estimated effort and time required info to tasks.
- Use a novel ordering system to create daily task lists.
- Sync with other todo apps to create daily todo lists.
- Add your tasks to calendar.
- See stats, be graded on your performance.
	
## Why?

Some people struggle to keep proper todo lists and get overwhelmed with the huge list of tasks they have and lose track, letting their todo lists go to waste. This app is specifically designed to be smart and enforce certain productivity methods to avoid these problems.
	
## Who is this for?

This app is for everyone who needs todo lists but mainly targets people who struggle to keep todo lists. It can be used by anyone but while in development mainly targets students.

## How?

The system is a todo list app where users will add the tasks they have in mind and give it certain properties. The app will require user to enter following properties for each task. Users should classify the task with the context it is in (Office, School, Home, Daily Life). Users can also enter the place where this task is depending on (for example cleaning can only be done at home). Then users will enter deadline, priority and estimated time required for this task. They can also add tags to classify tasks even further. The app will also let users define projects which are tasks that need multiple steps to be completed. 

Based on the info user has given Taskbank will create specilized daily tasklists to the user. This will happen when user launches the web app for the first time during that day. User will have the oppurtinity to lessen or increase the amount of tasks Taskbank gives to them that day. They can also change the tasks. Taskbank will also be able sync with Google Tasks (and maybe with other ToDo List apps) to create daily todo lists on Google tasks for the user.

To gamify the process and let user see their progress Taskbank will grade the user depending on how consistent they are with their tasks and display their stats, such as how many days they went without missing tasks in a single day.

## Scope:

Taskbank is not a simple project because it isn't just a todo list but has many features that require complex implementations. And since these features are so integrated with each other, there are a lot of aspects that needs careful implementation. Also UI design is an important part of Taskbank since app should feel not too limitting for the user and be smooth to use.

Taskbank is also not too ambitious because it is very modular. After the core part is implemented (which is a todo list) other features can easily be added or removed. If certain features prove difficult, they can always be removed from the plan or changed to make it easier. This wouldn't interfere with other parts of the project.
