## How?

The system is a todo list app where users will add the tasks they have in mind with certain properties. The app will require user to enter following properties for each task. Users should classify the task with the context it is in (Office, School, Home, Daily Life). Users can also enter the place where this task is depending on (for example cleaning can only be done at home). Then users will enter deadline, priority and estimated time required for this task. They will also add tags. Then the system will show everyday the tasks required that day.

App will also let users define grand tasks or tasks that need multiple steps.

Taskbank will also be able sync with Google Tasks to create daily todo list on Google tasks for the user. Taskbank will automatically do this everyday.

To gamify and see your progress Taskbank will grade the user depending on how consistent they are with their tasks and show their stats, for example how many days they went without missing tasks in a single day.

Everyday task bank will list the tasks it plans for you today and the user will be able to adjust it depending on less or more effort.

## Scope:

Taskbank is not a simple project because it isn't just a todo list but has many features that require implementation. Because these features are so intertwined with each other, it makes it harder to implement. Also UI design is an important part of Taskbank since app should feel not too limitting for the user and

Taskbank is also not too ambitious because it is very modular. After the core part is implemented (which is a todo list) other features can easily be added or removed. If certain features prove difficult, they can always be removed from the plan or changed to make it easier.
